This is the class binding for features of PeerJS [http://peerjs.com/].
	
PeerJS wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API.
Equipped with nothing but an ID, a peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer.
	
-- I'm doing this library as helper for my main projects so it will evolve according to my needs --
